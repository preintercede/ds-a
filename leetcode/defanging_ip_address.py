'''Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]".

Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"'''


class Solution:
    def defangIPaddr(self, address: str) -> str:
        # use replace method and replace . with [.]
        newAddress = address.replace('.', '[.]')
        return newAddress
