Need a head to know where the linked list starts

Compared to arrays:
- Elements of linked lists are independent objects
- Size of a linked list is not predefined
- Insertions and removals for very efficient
- Accessing an element is efficient in arrays since you can just access the element if you know where it is
- For linked lists, you have to iterate over the list

Types of linked lists
- Singly Linked List

- Circular Singly Linked List 

- Doubly Linked List
