Need a head to know where the linked list starts

Compared to arrays:
- Elements of linked lists are independent objects
- Size of a linked list is not predefined
- Insertions and removals for very efficient
- Accessing an element is efficient in arrays since you can just access the element if you know where it is
- For linked lists, you have to iterate over the list

Types of linked lists
- Singly Linked List
    Create head and tail; initialize with null
    Create blank node and assign a value to it and reference it as null
    Link head and tail with the nodes

    Insertion:
        At the beginning of linked list
        After node in middle of linked list
        At the end of the linked list

        Create the node and assign the value
        If head=none, head=node tail=node
        Else: location = first
